## Getting started

Start here to get acquainted with the core concepts of Bayesian analysis and PyMC. The following resources only assume a very basic knowledge of code and statistics.

:::{grid-item-card} Bayesian Methods for Hackers

By Cameron Davidson-Pilon

The "hacker" in the title  means learn-as-you-code. This hands-on introduction teaches intuitive definitions of the Bayesian approach to statistics, worklflow and decision-making by applying them using PyMC.

:::{grid-item-card} Bayesian Analysis with Python

by Osvaldo Martin

A great introductory book written by a maintainer of PyMC. It provides a hands-on introduction to the main concepts of Bayesian statistics using synthetic and real data sets. Mastering the concepts in this book is a great foundation to pursue more advanced knowledge.

## Using PyMC

(the path in pymc-examples repo excluding the `examples` folder, or using manual anchors if we decide to create them).
